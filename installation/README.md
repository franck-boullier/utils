# Overview

This is where we store all the scripts and stuff that help us configure things faster.

These are (most of the time) bash scripts that you can use to install stuff on a Linux machine.

# How to use this:

I try to explain how to use the code that I store there in the tutorial or article that uses this code.

See also [How to create DEV machines](./create_dev_machines.md) in this repo for more details.

You can also open each file: I try to add a lot of comments there to describe, understand, and remember what everything is supposed to do. These comments will hopefully help you too.

# Tips and Tricks:

To check the status of a bash script that is currently running in the background you can open a terminal window on the machine and run the command
```
sudo journalctl -f -o cat
```
This displays the output of the script that's running in the background.
Once done you can exit with `Crtl C`.
