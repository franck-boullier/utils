# Overview

This is where we store all the scripts and stuff that help us configure things faster.

These are (most of the time) bash scripts that you can use to install stuff on a Linux machine.

# How to use this:

I try to explain how to use the code that I store there in the tutorial or article that uses this code.

You can also open each file: I try to add a lot of comments there to describe, understand, and remember what everything is supposed to do. These comments will hopefully help you too.

# DISCLAIMER:

There is no guarantee that the code here will work for you. 

It's always a good idea to make sure that you understand what you're doing, and anyway, you use the code in this repository at your own risks!
